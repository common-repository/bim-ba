BIM-ba is a very basic BIM (Building Information Modeling). You can model an apartment and visit it in Virtual Reality.

== Description ==

BIM-ba is a very basic BIM at it's first steps.
You can model rooms and assemble them into an apartment, apply images and materials, add some furniture, all in the admin.
You will then be able to navigate into your creation directly from the WordPress front end, and gather some useful dimensional information.  

Activate the plugin and find the BIM-ba menu in the admin screen. Add a 3D-ambient custom post type as your first room to model.
Name the room and add some information, if you want. 3D-ambient CPT is hyerarchical, so nest the room (child) into the apartment (parent).

Below the editor you will find a series of metaboxes. First you can provide general information about your ambient, height and materials.
If you have an image for your floor you can add it here. Materials come from a dropdown menu (see below).

Once you have set the general rules for your ambient, let's start building the walls. Just specify direction of wall and length.
Add consecutive walls, as many as you need to enclose the ambient. Feel free to add images and materials to the walls, and open doors and windows.

Some furniture is available, select a wall and place the furniture relating it to wall origin.

Now save and click on "View 3D Ambient". On the front end, below title and description you will see a window showing your room in perspective.
Click and drag with the mouse to look around. Use WASD keys to navigate. Click on the visor icon to watch full screen.
On some devices image will be split in two, with a stereoscopic effect.

Materials are stored into another custom post type (3D-material). 
By now you can only provide a 1x1 meter image and the color of the material, but later on other attributes will be available.

Ambients are placed relative to their parent, using the Global Positioning metabox.
If you view the parent ambient, all it's children will be rendered too. 

Plugin uses the A-Frame JavaScript library to render the model (version 0.5.0), and CMB2 / CMB2-Conditionals plugins to handle the metaboxes.
All dependencies are packed within BIM-ba, so you're not forced to install them.

Since version 1.0.2 a very basic structural analisys module is available using the shortcode [steel_deck] in your posts and pages. Shortcode provides calculation
of a steel deck given size, materials, profiles and design criterion.

Prior to version 2.0.0 the plugin existed only as a Studio Management tool. This part has been discarded for plugin now focuses on the modeling aspect.
Previous files are still there, but they are not recalled by the plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip `bim-ba` folder, then upload it to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Nothing else

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin work on multisites? =

Yes, it does.

= Does it work on all themes? =

Tested on Twenty Sixteen, but it should work on any theme.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is how the 'BIM-ba' menu appears.
2. Metaboxes of a 3D Ambient entry. 
3. Virtual Reality in action on the front end.
4. Dimension data is available on the front end.
